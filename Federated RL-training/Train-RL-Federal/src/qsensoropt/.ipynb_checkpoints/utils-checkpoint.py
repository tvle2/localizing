    """Training routine for the neural network
    or the custom controls.

    This function contains a cycle that
    performs a gradient descent optimization
    of the training variables of the control strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    simulation: :py:obj:`~.Simulation`
        Contains the complete description of the
        estimation task, and how the various components
        of it (particle filter, probe system, and control)
        interact to produce the estimator and the loss.
    optimizer: :py:obj:`Optimizer`
        This object applies the gradient to the trainable
        variables of the control strategy and realized therefore
        the update of the gradient descent step.
        The default optimizer to be chosen
        is `Adam` with the variable learning
        rate described in the
        class :py:obj:`~.InverseSqrtDecay`.
    iterations: int
        Number of update steps in the training of the
        strategy. It is the number of complete executions
        of a batch of estimation tasks for training the controls.
    save_path: str
        Path containing the intermediate trained variables,
        that are saved each `interval_save` iterations,
        and the history of the loss at the end of the
        training.
    interval_save: int = 128
        Number of iterations of the training cycle
        between two consecutive saving of the training
        variables on disk.
    network: :py:obj:`Model`, optional
        Neural network model used in the `simulation`
        object to parametrize the control strategy.
        In `simulation` it is wrapped inside the
        `control_strategy` attribute and there the
        :py:obj:`~.Simulation` object has no direct access
        to its trainable variables. If no neural network
        is used in the estimation, for example
        because a static strategy is being trained,
        this parameter can be omitted.
    custom_controls: :py:obj:`Variable`, optional
        It is possible to train a control strategy that
        goes beyond what can be done with a neural network,
        by writing a custom `control_strategy` function
        which is not only a wrapper for the neural
        network. The trainable variables of this custom
        strategy are contained in the object object
        `custom_controls`.

        The typical application is that of a **static strategy**,
        that is a control strategy that depends only
        on the measurement step and not on the
        posterior distribution moments. This is a
        non-adaptive strategy, that therefore
        doesn't need to be
        computed in real time, but can be hard coded before
        the beginning of the estimation.
        Such approach will save memory, because the
        Bayesian analysis can be postponed
        and performed on a more powerful device,
        and it will also be faster, because no
        computation is necessary between two
        measurements, since the approach is
        non-adaptive. Of course one can't expect
        in general the same performances of the
        adaptive strategy.
    load_best: bool = True
        Keeps track of the loss of the control strategy
        during the training and picks the best model
        instead of the last. To pick the best model
        the loss is averaged over
        `interval_save` update steps.
    gradient_accumulation: int = 1
        This controls the "effective" batchsize of the
        training. In the training loop for each
        update of the variables the method
        :py:meth:`~.Simulation.execute` runs
        a number `gradient_accumulation` of times
        and the gradients computed from each run
        are averaged before the update step
        is performed.
        In this way, given `bs` the true batchsize of the
        `simulation` object, the "effective" batchsize
        of the training is
        `gradient_accumulation*bs`, which is the number of
        independent simulations that contribute to a single
        update step of the training variables. This feature
        can be used to increase the batchsize, when the
        memory on the machine is limited,
        since the maximum amount of memory required
        by the training is determine by
        `bs` and is independent on
        `gradient_accumulation`.
    xla_compile: bool = True
        Just-in-time XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)
        compilation for the strategy training.
        It should reduce the memory and training
        time on a GPU.


        **Achtung!** Not all the Tensorflow
        operations can be compiled with XLA.

        **Achtung!** It might not perform well on a CPU.
