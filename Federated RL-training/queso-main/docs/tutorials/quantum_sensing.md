# Quantum sensing

Quantum sensing uses the properties of quantum particles to beat classical limits on precision, resolution, and sensitivity.
For example, the properties of quantum mechanics including superposition, entanglement, and squeezing, are the basis for this 'quantum advantage'.

## Quantum sensing protocols
Sensing protocols are realized in myriad ways.


## Quantum circuits as a representation of sensing protocols

### A one-qubit sensing protocol

$$ \vert \psi \rangle = \vert 0 \rangle + \vert 0 \rangle $$
