class ParticleFilter:
    r"""
    Particle filter object, with methods to reset the
    particle ensemble and perform Bayesian filtering
    for quantum metrology.

    Given the tuple of unknown parameters
    :math:`\vec \theta=(\theta_1, \theta_2, \cdots, \theta_d)`,
    in the Bayesian framework we start from a prior
    :math:`p(\theta)` and update it after each observation
    through the Bayes rule. In simulating such procedure
    (called Bayesian filtering) we need a computer
    representation of a generic probability distribution
    on the parameters. We can approximate a distribution
    :math:`p(\theta)` with a weighted sum of delta functions
    as follows:

    .. math::
        p(\vec \theta) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_j
        \delta(\vec \theta - \vec \theta_j),

    where the vectors :math:`\vec \theta_j` are called particles,
    while the real numbers :math:`w_i` are the weights.
    The integer :math:`N` is the attribute `np` of the
    :py:obj:`ParticleFilter` object. The core idea is that
    the posterior distribution is represented by an ensemble of
    particles and weights
    :math:`\lbrace (\vec \theta_j, w_j) \rbrace_{j=1}^N`.
    The Bayesian filtering techniques that use this kind of
    representations for the posterior are called particle
    filter methods.

    In the figure, we represent the ensemble of a
    two-dimensional particle filter, where the intensity
    of the color is proportional to the weight
    associated with each particle.

    .. image:: ../docs/_static/particle_filter_representation.png
        :width: 400
        :alt: particle_filter_representation

    The update of the posterior in the particle filter
    becomes the update of the weights :math:`w_i`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bs: int
        Batchsize of the particle filter,
        i.e. number of Bayesian estimations
        performed simultaneously.
    np: int
        Parameter `num_particles` passed to the
        constructor of the class.
        It is the number of particles in the ensemble.
    phys_model: :py:obj:`~.PhysicalModel`
        Abstract description of the physical model
        of the quantum probe passed to the
        :py:obj:`ParticleFilter` constructor.
        It also contains the description of the parameters
        to estimate, on the basis of which the particles of
        the ensemble are initialized.
    resampling: bool
        Flag `resampling_allowed` passed
        to the constructor of
        :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`.

        **Achtung!** This attribute has no effect inside the methods
        of the :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`. Calling the method
        :py:meth:`full_resampling` will resample the
        particles if needed also with `resampling=False`.

    state_size: int
        Size of the state of the probe,
        it is `phys_model.state_specifics["size"]`,
        where `phys_model` is the attribute of
        :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`.
    state_type: str
        Type of the state vector of the probe,
        it is `phys_model.state_specifics["type"]`,
        where `phys_model` is the attribute
        of :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`.
    d: int
        Number of unknown parameters of the simulation,
        it is the length of the attribute `params`.
    prec: str
        Floating point precision of the parameter values.
        Can be either `float32` or `float64`.
        It is the parameter `prec` passed to the constructor.

    Notes
    -----
    This class can deal with a whole batch of particle
    filter ensembles that are updated simultaneously.
    The batchsize attribute `bs` is taken from
    `phys_model` in the initialization.

    This implementation of the particle filter is
    fully differentiable and can, therefore, be
    used in the training loop of a neural network agent
    that controls the experiment. It is trivial to see
    that the Bayes update is differentiable, while the
    differentiability of the resampling [3]_ is achieved
    through a combination of soft resampling [4]_
    and the method of Ścibior and Wood [5]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_particles: int
            Number of particles in the ensemble of the
            particle filter.
        phys_model: :py:obj:`~.PhysicalModel`
            Contains the physics of the quantum probe and the
            methods to operate on its state and compute the
            probabilities of observing
            a certain outcome in a measurement.
            This object is used in the
            :py:meth:`apply_measurement` method,
            which performs the Bayesian update on the
            particle weights.
        resampling_allowed: bool = True
            Controls whether the resampling is allowed
            or not for a particular instance of
            :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`. The typical case in
            which we set `resampling_flag=False` is that
            of hypothesis testing, where we have a single
            discrete parameter and `num_particles` equals
            the number of hypotheses.

            This flag isn't used directly in this class,
            but in the
            :py:obj:`~.StatelessSimulation`
            and
            :py:obj:`~.StatefulSimulation`
            classes, which use
            the methods of :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`.
        resample_threshold: float = 0.5
            The method :py:meth:`full_resampling` verifies the need
            for resampling for a certain particle filter
            ensemble according to the *effective particle number*,
            defined as

            .. math::
                N_{\text{eff}} := \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^N
                w_j^2} \; .
                :label: effN

            Indicating with :math:`r_t` the `resample_threshold`,
            the particle filter identifies an ensemble as
            in need of resampling when
            :math:`N_{\text{eff}}<r_t N`.
        resample_fraction: float = 0.98
            The method :py:meth:`full_resampling`
            triggers the resampling
            for the whole batch of particle filter ensembles
            if at least
            a fraction `resample_fraction` of simulations
            are in need of resampling. Also those simulations in
            the batch that don't need resampling will
            be resampled.
        alpha: float = 0.5
            In the method :py:meth:`resample`
            an importance sampling of the particles is performed,
            where the extraction is done from a distribution,
            being the one defined by the ensemble
            mixed with a uniform distribution on
            the particles. This procedure, called *soft resampling*,
            aims to make the update step differentiable.
            The mixing coefficient is the parameter `alpha`,
            and it is indicated with
            :math:`\alpha` in the equations.

            This parameter quantitatively controls the flow of
            derivatives through the resampling routine and the
            effectiveness of the resampling. With `alpha=1`,
            regular resampling without mixing occurs, but no
            derivatives can flow through this operation.
            With `alpha=0`, differentiability is achieved,
            but no resampling is done. There is a tradeoff
            between the efficiency of the soft resampling
            and its differentiability.
        beta: float = 0.98
            In the method :py:meth:`resample`, a Gaussian
            perturbation of the particles obtained from the
            soft resampling is performed. The intensity of
            this perturbation is controlled by the parameter
            `1.0-beta`, which is indicated by :math:`\beta`
            in the equations.
        gamma: float = 1.0
            This parameter controls the fraction of `num_particles`
            that are extracted in the soft resampling.
            The remaining fraction of particles, `1.0-gamma`,
            are newly generated from a Gaussian
            distribution having the same mean and variance as
            the posterior distribution before the resampling.
            This parameter, like `alpha` and `beta`, regulates
            the behavior of the :py:meth:`resample` method and
            is indicated by :math:`\gamma` in the equations.

            **Achtung!**  Proposing new particles during a
            resampling won't work when
            one ore more discrete parameters are present.
            The advice in these cases is to keep `gamma=1.0`.
        scibior_trick: bool = True
            This flag controls the use of the method proposed
            by Ścibior and Wood to make the resampling differentiable.
            It can be used alone or together with soft resampling
            to improve the flow of the gradient
            through the particle ensemble resampling steps.
        trim: bool = True
            After the Gaussian perturbation of the particles
            or their extraction from scratch from a Gaussian,
            they may fall outside the admissible bounds for the
            parameters. If `trim=True`, they are cast again inside
            the bounds using the function
            :py:func:`~.parameter.trim_single_param`.
        prec: str = "float64"
            This parameter indicates the floating-point precision
            of the particles and weights, it can be either
            `float64` or `float32`.

        r"""Resample routine of the particle filter.

        The resampling procedure works in three steps.
        First, we mix the probability distribution on the
        particles represented by the weights :math:`w_j`
        with a uniform distribution and construct the
        soft-weights :math:`q_j` defined as:

        .. math::
            q_j = \alpha w_j + (1-\alpha) \frac{1}{N} \; ,

        The new particles :math:`\vec{\theta}_j'` are resampled
        from the ensemble :math:`\lbrace \vec{\theta}_j, q_j \rbrace`
        and the new weight associated with each resampled particle is:

        .. math::
            w_j' \propto \frac{w_{\phi(j)}}{\alpha w_{\phi(j)} +
            (1-\alpha)\frac{1}{N}} \; ,

        where :math:`\phi(j)` is the original index in the
        old ensemble of the `j`-th particle in the new ensemble.
        The function :math:`\phi` is in general neither injective
        nor surjective. Only a fraction `gamma` of the total particles
        `np` is resampled in this way, and their weights are normalized
        such that they sum to `gamma`, i.e.

        .. math::
            \sum_{j=1}^{\gamma N} w_j' = \gamma \; .

        The second step is to perturb the newly extracted
        particles :math:`\vec{\theta}_j'` as follows:

        .. math::
            \vec{\theta}_j'' = \beta \vec{\theta}_j' +
            (1-\beta) \vec{\mu} + \vec{\delta} \; ,

        where :math:`\vec{\mu}` is the mean value of the
        parameters calculated from the ensemble before
        the resampling with the method :py:meth:`compute_mean`,
        and :math:`\vec{\delta}` is a random variable extracted
        from a Gaussian distribution, i.e.

        .. math::
            \vec{\delta} \sim \mathcal{N} (0, (1-\beta^2) \Sigma) \; ,

        with :math:`\Sigma` being the covariance matrix
        of the ensemble, computed with the method
        :py:meth:`compute_covariance`. The third and last step
        of the resampling routine is to propose new particles.
        These are again extracted from a Gaussian distribution, i.e.

        .. math::
            \vec{\theta}_j'' \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}, \Sigma) \; .

        A number :math:`(1-\gamma)N` of particles are sampled
        in this way with :math:`N`
        being the total number of particles `np`. Their weights
        are uniform and normalized to :math:`1-\gamma`, so that
        together with the particles produced in the first two
        steps, their weights sum to one.

        Parameters
        ----------
        weights: Tensor
            `Tensor` of weights of shape (`bs`, `np`) and of type `prec`.

        Notes
        -----
        It is possible that the soft resampling produces
        an invalid set of new weights (i.e., all zeros) for cases
        where there are very few particles and highly
        concentrated weights. In such limit cases, the soft
        resampling is aborted, and a normal resampling
        (without mixing with the uniform distribution) is executed
        to ensure that valid weights are produced.

        and updated in the measurement loop
        inside the method

        and the new particles. That is the role of this method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        index: Tensor
            `Tensor` of shape (,) and type `int32` that
            contains the number of iterations of the measurement
            loop in
            :py:meth:`~.Simulation.execute`,
            as this method is called.
        particles: Tensor
            `Tensor` of particles of shape
            (`bs`, `np`, `d`)
            and of type `prec`.
            `d` is an attribute of :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`.
        hist_outcomes_rec: Tensor
            `Tensor` of shape
            (`num_step`, `bs`, `phys_model.outcomes_size`)
            and of type `prec`. It contains the
            history of the outcomes
            of the measurements for all the
            estimations in the batch
            up to the point at which this method is called.
            It is generated
            automatically in the
            :py:meth:`~.Simulation.execute`
            method.
        hist_control_rec: Tensor
            `Tensor` of shape
            (`num_steps`, `bs`, `phys_model.control_size`)
            and of type `prec`.
            It contains the history of the controls
            of the measurements for all the
            estimations in the batch
            up to the point at which
            this method is called. It is generated
            automatically in the
            :py:meth:`~.Simulation.execute`
            method.
        hist_step_rec: Tensor
            `Tensor` of shape (`num_steps`, `bs`, 1)
            that contains, for
            each loop of the measurement cycle, the
            index of the last
            measurement performed on each estimation
            in the batch. Different estimations
            can terminate with a different number of
            total measurements
            performed.
            This `Tensor` is fundamentally a
            table that shows for each loop of the
            measurement cycle
            (row index) the number of measurements performed
            up to that point for each estimation (column index).
            Because for some loops the measurement
            might be applied only
            to a subset of estimations, some cells can show
            a number of measurements lower than the current
            number of completed loops in the measurement cycle.
            This `Tensor` is generated
            automatically in the
            :py:meth:`~.Simulation.execute`
            method.
        hist_continue_rec: Tensor
            A `Tensor` of shape (`num_steps`, `bs`, 1)
            and type `int32`,
            `hist_continue_rec` is a flag `Tensor`
            indicating whether
            a simulation in the batch is ended or not.
            This flag is necessary because different simulations
            may stop at different numbers of measurements.
            The typical column of `hist_continue_rec` consists
            of a series of contiguous ones, say in number of `M`,
            followed by zeros until the end of the row.
            This tells us that the particular simulation to which
            the row refers, consisted of `M` measurements so far.
            In recomputing the state with different values
            for the particles, `M` measurement should be performed
            for that particular simulation.
            The parameter `hist_continue_rec`
            is generated automatically in the
            `Simulation.execute` method and could be easily derived
            from `hist_step_rec`, which contains more information.
        batchsize: Tensor
            Dynamical batchsize of the recomputed states.
        num_steps: int
            The maximum number of steps in the training loop.
            It is the attribute `num_steps`
            of the data class :py:obj:`SimulationParameters`.

        Returns
        -------
        state_ensemble: Tensor
            The state of the quantum probe associated
            with each entry of `particles`, that has been
            recomputed using the applied controls and the
            observed outcomes. Each entry of `state_ensemble` is
            the state of the probe computed as if the true values
            of the parameters were the particles of the ensemble.
            When these are resampled, the states do not refer
            anymore to the correct values of the parameters, and
            the only way to realign them is to recompute them
            from scratch. `state_ensemble` is a `Tensor` of
            shape (`bs`, `np`, `state_size`) and type `state_type`,
            where `state_size` and `state_type` are attributes
            of :py:obj:`ParticleFilter`.

        Notes
        -----
        The stopping condition in the
        measurement loop,
        which determines the number of measurements
        for an estimation,
        depends on the number of computed resources,
        which depends only on the applied controls and
        observed outcomes.
        For this reason, it is possible to reuse the objects
        `hist_step_rec` and `hist_continue_rec`, which
        were generated
        before the resampling. For the same reason, these objects
        are actually superfluous in the function call,
        as they could be
        recomputed from the `hist_outcomes_rec` and
        `hist_continue_rec` parameters.

        weights: Tensor
            A `Tensor` of weights with shape (`bs`, `np`)
